<h3>About</h3>

<p>This directory contains a relational database project I created during grad school. Ignore the PHP..it's definitely not my framework of choice (much rather use Rails or Django).</p>

<p>While this code was made to higher-level undergraduate standards and suffered greatly from my increased focus on graduate work and rock climbing, I believe the logical design is sound. Further, the scope of this project is actually a long-maintained interest of mine..which probably explains why I am so inextricably shackled to services like Evernote while still being utterly disappointed in their lack of functionality. With some ready cash and free weekends (and a beer or three), I plan on finishing this personal project of mine. Maybe a bored android dishwasher will use it someday to write its memoirs.</p>

<p><strong>This project is not designed with any intention of deployability. It should merely exemplify my working knowledge of SQL and database theory, and give some public credo to one of my long-standing personal interests.</strong>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p><code>Code/</code> directory contains all coffee-fueled hackery of PHP app, <code>Documentation</code> contains the workspace versions of my LaTeX documentation (Compiled version in <code>ProjectDocumentation.pdf</code>). The SQL dump for the underlying database is in <code>thought_experiments.sql</code></p>
