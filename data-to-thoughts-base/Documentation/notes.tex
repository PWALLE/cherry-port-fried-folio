\section{Last Notes}
There are some inconsistencies between the earlier parts of this document
and the EER diagram, and the remaining portions that were filled in more recently.
For example, multimedia has temporarily been reduced to a single table for brevity
and in the interest of time.
Certain functionality such as linking and audio/video attachments are not yet supported.
I would have removed these inconsistencies, but I wanted to keep them as a reminder of future work to be done.
I hope to further develop this site and eventually deploy it as a travel
aide while I am traveling abroad.  Thanks for your understanding!
