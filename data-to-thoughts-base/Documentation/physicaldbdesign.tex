\section{Physical Database Design and Table Contents}
For an in-depth look at my physical database design
and table contents, check out the attached mysqldump
in \emph{thought\_experiments.sql}. For a general overview,
however, I will note that the database contains tables
for the three primary entities (thought experiments, text sections, multimedia),
    tables for comments and moods, and associative tables 
    which connect the primary entities.
