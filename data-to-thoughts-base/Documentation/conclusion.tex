\section{Conclusion}
In this database project, I have completed a sufficiently complex
database schema and have implemented it in MySQL.
I have populated my database within reason,
and provided a useful web application interface which
allows users to easily access and leverage my database.
The site itself has been published on the departmental ix server,
and my code and data are immediately available there.

Given more time, I would like to expand the capabilities and usability
of the web interface.  The database design itself is simple but elegant--
it allows a satisfactory representation of the thought experiments I wish
to store.  If the interface was improved functionally and aesthetically,
I think it would be a useful personal tool/collection.
However, I do want to investigate the ability to link multiple thought
experiments and entities together somehow, and this will involve
modifications to the underlying database.
I also want to be able to support more than just image features--
in particular, I would like to be able to embed video and audio,
and leverage Amazan cloud storage if possible.
These agenda items form the core of my future work on this project.
