\section{Summary}
I would like to build a database for storing and composing multimedia thought experiments.  What I define to be a \textbf{thought experiment} is \emph{a written exposition (journal entry, idea, blog post, etc) containing one to many sections of text and zero to many links or attachments of multimedia}.  Most of the stored data will be text-based, with occasional serialized data storage for multimedia (though likely a far better solution would be to store urls to cloud-stored media).  The applications that I see desirable are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compose and store thought experiments; 
\item View thought experiments in arbitrary categories (keyword searches, etc); 
\item Modify, augment and edit thought experiments; 
\item Comment on thought experiments and link them to other thoughts; and 
\item Load thought experiments into a common format (pdf, html, jpeg, etc).
\end{itemize}
