\section{Logical Design}
A thought experiment has a title, date created, last modified, and an experiment\_category (idea, blog post, journal, to do, etc). Experiment categories belong to a mutable set of categories.  A thought experiment may contain one to many text sections, and zero to many multimedia attachments.  Multimedia attachments can be outside web links, audio, video, or images.  The attachments can be handled via serialization in the form of blob data (maybe ok for images), but would probably do better with a stored url to an external media source.  Text sections have a date created and date modified, a paragraph-ish length bit of text, and a thought\_category (separate from experiment\_category, but similar idea: thought, poem, prose, question, reflection, quote, etc).  All text sections, multimedia, and thought experiments can be commented on, and comments include date created, references (one of immutable set of {text, audio, video, picture, link, thought\_experiment, etc}), and the actual comment.  All thought experiments, multimedia, and text sections can have a mood genre.
