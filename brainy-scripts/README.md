<h3>About</h3>

<p>This is a Python script for an id3 decision tree learner.
It trains the learner on given training input,
tests the learner on test input,
and outputs a model of the decision tree.
I completed this script for Machine Learning at the University of Oregon.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I also wrote scripts for Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and perceptron learners.
These were less interesting than this script in terms of demonstrating coding ability
and were not included for brevity. I can provide them if needed. ~PWALLE</p>
