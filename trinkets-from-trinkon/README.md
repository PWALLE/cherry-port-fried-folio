<h3>About</h3>

<p>This is a code snippet from the Trinkon project, a Facebook application
that I worked on as a software engineering consultant.
In <code>app_controller.rb</code>, I demonstrate--among other things--my work
on the user authentication pipeline using OAuth and the Facebook API.
In <code>give_gift_friends.html.erb</code>, I demonstrate some work I did on the frontend,
including some simple Javascript.
The actual application can be found <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/Trinkon/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I forced some code wrapping for readability. RoR tends to dislike code wrapping,
so when I was working on this application I used an IDE and dealt with the
horizontal scroll irritably. I'm saying this to ward off a warranted (but mistaken)
conclusion that I don't know a fig about Ruby.</p>

<p>Also, a note from the owner of this proprietary code:
    "The code samples are proprietary code and belong to Trinkon, LLC. <br>
    I am sharing them with the permission of the owner of Trinkon 
    solely for the purpose of assisting my job search. <br>
    The owner asks that you delete the code fragments
    when you are done using them to evaluate me."</p>
