Here is the example code from class Tuesday, May 21, fleshed out a bit and tested. 

Files: 
    Makefile holds the recipes for compiling the code.
    driver.c is a simple driver program in C, to call ll_main.
    dispatch.c is the simulation of object structures and object-oriented dispatch, coded
       entirely in C.   (I'll repeat this exercise with llvm code for Thursday.) 
    
    mini.ll:  A tiny hand-coded llvm function example.  We'll expand on this soon. 

    To test (on a unixoid, including Linux and MacOS; possibly also under cygwin on windows): 
      - Edit the Makefile, changing the definition of LLVM to be where you put the LLVM tools
      - "make dispatch"   (should create some .ll files as well as an executable called "dispatch")
      - ./dispatch        (running the binary you created)
