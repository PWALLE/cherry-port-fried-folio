<h3>About</h3>

<p>This is a compiler for YASL (Yet Another Simple Language) which I completed 
for my Compilers course at DePauw University. It is written in C++, and is 
a complete compiler, from scanner to parser to machine code generation.  </p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I completed this on a PC lab computer using Visual Studio. 
It does not compile on Unix due to a library issue, 
but it should illustrate my coding abilities from my undergraduate years.</p>
