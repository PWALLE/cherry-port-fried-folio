<h3>About</h3>

<p>Here is some sample code from a web tool I created as an independent contractor in
2013. The program is a ticket recording app built to replace the paper ticket
system employed in a fruit company in my hometown.
It is coded in RoR, and demonstrates my abilities with that platform.</p>

<p>Further, of note, I researched, proposed, designed, and implemented this tool
entirely on my own. It adheres fairly well to the Ruby design standards, though
I am still working on a non-IDE fix for RoR's detestation of code wrapping.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I have included most of the MVC files, the routes, and some key documentation
that I wrote for the client. Pardon the colloqialisms. ~PWALLE</p>
