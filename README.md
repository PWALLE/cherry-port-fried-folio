<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The following directories contain source code from a variety of projects and
odds and ends from my undergraduate and graduate years. I intend this to be a sort
of programming portfolio, for job interviews or self-glorification.</p>

<p>This repo is by no means comprehensive (read: yes, I coded more than four projects
in college). Notably missing are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trivial programs</li>
<li>Programs with coding concepts that are already demonstrable in the included set
of projects---including them would have been redundant.</li>
<li>Programs that I am not allowed to share due to copyright or licensing agreements,
or pinky swears-to-secrecy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy with coffee or malty beverage. ~PWALLE</p>
